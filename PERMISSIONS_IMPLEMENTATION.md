# Role-Based and Status-Based Permissions Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of role-based and status-based permissions for invoice management in the EFacture Express application.

## Permission Matrix Implementation

### Role Hierarchy
- **Admin**: Highest privileges (Level 3)
- **Manager**: Medium privileges (Level 2)  
- **Clerk**: Basic privileges (Level 1)

### Invoice Status Flow
```
Draft (0) → Ready (1) → AwaitingClearance (2) → Validated (3) / Rejected (4)
```

## Key Implementation Files

### 1. `src/utils/permissions.ts` (New)
Central permissions utility providing:
- **Core Permission Functions**: `canModifyInvoice()`, `canDeleteInvoice()`, `canSubmitInvoice()`
- **Status Transition Logic**: `getValidStatusTransitions()`, `canTransitionToStatus()`
- **Bulk Operations**: `canSelectForBulkOperation()`
- **UI Helpers**: `getInvoiceActionPermissions()`

### 2. `src/components/InvoiceList.tsx` (Updated)
- Replaced scattered permission checks with centralized utility calls
- Updated bulk selection logic to use proper permission validation
- Improved individual invoice action buttons with permission-based rendering
- Fixed checkbox enabling/disabling logic

### 3. `src/components/InvoiceForm.tsx` (Updated)
- Added dynamic status transition validation
- Implemented proper status selection based on user role and current status
- Added support for Ready ↔ Draft transitions
- Enhanced status display with proper color coding

## Permission Rules Implemented

### Global Capabilities ✅
- **Create Invoice**: All roles (Admin, Manager, Clerk)
- **Import CSV**: All roles (Admin, Manager, Clerk)

### Clerk Role ✅
**Draft Status (0):**
- ✅ Can modify content
- ✅ Can delete invoice

**All Other Statuses (1,2,3,4):**
- ❌ Cannot modify content
- ❌ Cannot delete invoice
- ❌ Cannot change status
- ❌ Cannot perform DGI submission

### Manager & Admin Roles ✅

**Draft Status (0):**
- ✅ Can modify content
- ✅ Can delete invoice
- ✅ Can change to Ready status

**Ready Status (1):**
- ✅ Can modify content
- ✅ Can delete invoice
- ✅ Can perform DGI submission
- ✅ Can change back to Draft status

**AwaitingClearance Status (2):**
- ❌ Cannot modify content
- ❌ Cannot delete invoice
- ✅ Can trigger DGI status check
- ❌ Cannot change status manually

**Validated Status (3):**
- ❌ All operations blocked (immutable)

**Rejected Status (4):**
- ✅ Can modify content
- ✅ Can delete invoice  
- ✅ Can change to Draft status
- ✅ Can access rejection reason

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Status Transition Matrix
```typescript
Draft → [Draft, Ready]          // Managers/Admins only
Ready → [Draft, Ready]          // Managers/Admins can revert
AwaitingClearance → [AwaitingClearance]  // Locked until DGI response
Validated → [Validated]         // Immutable
Rejected → [Draft, Rejected]    // Managers/Admins can restart
```

### 2. Bulk Operations
- **Smart Selection**: Only invoices with valid permissions are selectable
- **Filtered Actions**: Bulk submit/delete only acts on permitted invoices
- **Visual Feedback**: Disabled checkboxes for unpermitted actions

### 3. UI Permission Integration
- **Dynamic Action Buttons**: Edit/Delete/Submit buttons appear based on permissions
- **Status Selection**: Only valid status transitions are shown in forms
- **Bulk Action Controls**: Submit/Delete bulk buttons enabled based on role

### 4. Rejected Invoice Handling
- Managers and Admins can edit/delete rejected invoices
- Rejection reasons are accessible and displayable
- Rejected invoices can be reverted to Draft status

## Technical Highlights

### Type Safety
```typescript
export type UserRole = 'Admin' | 'Manager' | 'Clerk';
export type InvoiceStatus = 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
```

### Centralized Permission Checking
```typescript
const permissions = getInvoiceActionPermissions(userRole, invoiceStatus);
// Returns: { canEdit, canDelete, canSubmit, canChangeStatus, ... }
```

### Status Transition Validation
```typescript
const validTransitions = getValidStatusTransitions(userRole, currentStatus);
// Returns only allowed status transitions for the user
```

## Testing Results

### Build Status ✅
- TypeScript compilation: **PASSED**
- ESLint warnings: **Minor only**
- Build optimization: **SUCCESS**

### Permission Compliance ✅
All specified permission requirements have been implemented and verified:
- Global capabilities: ✅ Working
- Clerk restrictions: ✅ Working  
- Manager/Admin privileges: ✅ Working
- Status transition rules: ✅ Working
- AwaitingClearance locks: ✅ Working
- Validated immutability: ✅ Working
- Rejected invoice recovery: ✅ Working

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Centralized Logic**: All permission logic in one utility file
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper typing
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to modify rules without touching UI components
4. **Consistency**: Same permission logic used across all components
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new roles or status types
6. **Performance**: Efficient permission checking without redundant calculations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**: Extend permission validation to API layer
2. **Role Management**: Add UI for managing user roles
3. **Audit Trail**: Track permission-based actions for compliance
4. **Advanced Workflows**: Support for custom approval workflows
